As single-cell RNA sequencing technology advances rapidly, it is conceivable to investigate gene connections in a cell type-specific way. However, Single-cell network inference and analysis is a non-trivial task that requires solid statistical background, especially for data preprocessing and proper interpretation of results. As a result, novice researchers frequently struggle to choose the most suitable algorithms for their projects. In addition, several packages are needed for each step of a standard network analysis, and their distinct syntaxes can hinder interoperability between packages, particularly for non-advanced Python users.

Here we propose SCANet, a new python package that incorporates the inference of gene co-expression networks from single-cell gene expression data and a complete analysis of the identified modules through trait and cell type associations, hub genes detection, deciphering of co-regulatory signals in co-expression, and drug-gene interactions identification. This will likely accelerate network analysis pipelines and advance systems biology research.
