`SCANet`, a new python package that incorporates the inference of gene co-expression networks from single-cell gene expression data and a complete analysis of the identified modules through trait and cell type associations, hub genes detection, deciphering of co-regulatory signals in co-expression, and drug-gene interactions identification. This will likely accelerate network analysis pipelines and advance systems biology research.
