`SCANet`, a new python package that incorporates the inference of gene co-expression networks from single-cell gene expression data and a complete analysis of the identified modules through trait and cell type associations, hub genes detection, deciphering of co-regulatory signals in co-expression, and drug-gene interactions identification. This will likely accelerate network analysis pipelines and advance systems biology research.


## Installation

To install `SCANet`.
```console
pip install scanet
```
Finally, it should be possible to import drugstone to your python script.
````python
import scanet
````
You can use 
```python
import scanet as sn
```

`SCANet` officially supports Python 3.6+.
